Program Tasks and Thoughts: [July 22nd, 2023, Dylan Kawalec]

1. Store-files: Programatically generate and store keys using the design diagram's sequence of functions.

2. Edit main.rs to match the design board for poems.

3. Focus on working primarily in the StoredProcedure directory.

4. Review notes on how keys are utilized to generate interpretations from a stored value.

5. Build a record.json artifact containing values from both the Generation and StoredProcedure directories.

6. Implement two distinct functions in main.rs to handle generator and storage procedures, and proof-checking that relies on stored procedural information.

7. Use the record.json file to display the results on the poems-react front-end.


Store-files is how our program will programatically generate and store keys at the same time. The sequence of functions used will be based on our design diagram.

Edit the main.rs to prompt as the design board for poems.

make sure to be doing a majority of work in the StoredProcedure directory. 

Check notes on how the keys are used to generate interpretations from a stored value. 

This program has to be able to build a record.json artifact that contains the values generated from the Generation Directory, and from the StoredProcedure directory. 

The main Program collects the information, and then it must have a way to interpret and decrypt the values coming back. There should be two distinct functions in the main.rs file that operate the generator and storage procedures, and then proof check that rely's on the storage procedural information that will be used. the use will be from a record.json file that must be moved to the poems-react directory for the front-end to display.

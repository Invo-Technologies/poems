# create the record cipher field in JSON, and make sure to add these to JSON as well for the people to proof it works 
# after you prove the decryption worked. Manually use the Viewkey, and the RecordCipher, on aleo tools. 
# compare the z keys to the ones being stored. Test the removal of all Z keys except one of them to prove it works.
